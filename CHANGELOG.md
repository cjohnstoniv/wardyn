# Changelog

All notable changes to Wardyn are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); Wardyn is **pre-alpha**
and does not yet follow semantic versioning (interfaces are not stable).

**v0.3.1 and older live in [CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md](CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md).**

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **An audit webhook sink configured with a `bearer_token` now requires an
  `https://` URL.** The token is a long-lived SIEM ingest credential replayed on
  every POST, so a plaintext endpoint leaked it continuously. wardynd refuses to
  start instead. A tokenless `http://` collector is unaffected.

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-29

A clarity release: no new features, no API changes. A repo-wide audit rewrote the
docs around a single quickstart, redrew the architecture diagram, and fixed the
places where the docs described something the code does not do. It also found two
CI gates that had been passing without checking anything.

**Operators upgrading:** nothing to do — no schema, config, or interface changed.

**Maintainers:** the CI merge gate collapsed five single-command jobs into one
`gates` matrix, so the required status checks on `main` must be renamed from
`govulncheck`/`staticcheck`/`gitleaks`/`licenses`/`license-headers` to
`gates (<name>)`. Until that is applied, a pull request waits forever on contexts
that no longer report. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md), "Repo settings".

### Fixed

- **The nightly live e2e jobs were passing while their assertions failed.** Both
  steps pipe `make` into `tee` to capture evidence, but GitHub's implicit shell has
  no `pipefail`, so the step took `tee`'s exit code. These are the jobs that prove
  the L0 egress boundary, the metadata block, and the kill cascade.
- **`make dco` accepted any non-empty sign-off**, including `Signed-off-by: nobody` —
  the format assertion was lost when the check moved to git's trailer parsing.
- **The README claimed gVisor/CC2 is your default barrier.** `pick_policy` checks for
  a configured model first, so a gVisor host running a model gets a CC1 floor. All
  three outcomes are now stated.
- **`docs/ENV.md` documented an admin-token default that does not exist**, so a
  reader who set only `WARDYN_TOKEN` got an unauthenticated control plane: the real
  default is empty, and an empty token with no OIDC on loopback auto-enables no-auth
  local mode. Both the binary and compose defaults are now stated.
- **The compose README described the `make setup` menu backwards**, and told readers
  team/SSO was "coming soon" where the roadmap says it is not scheduled.
- **Example scenario commands now run as written** (`--policy`, `wardyn run list`,
  `wardyn deny`, and a policy file that actually parses).
- **The Helm docs quoted three different, all-wrong chart versions.**
- Three API payloads emitted `null` where they had emitted `[]`, one of them a live
  response body.

### Changed

- **The console's default sizing is back to 100%.** 0.4.0's 17.6px root font token is
  16px again, the sizing that shipped through 0.3.1. The `px`→`rem` text-utility
  conversion stays — those values were computed against a 16px base, so each reproduces
  its original size — and `--font-size` in `ui/src/styles/theme.css` remains the single
  knob for anyone who wants the larger console back.

- **Docs consolidated and de-duplicated (repo-wide audit).** The quickstart is told
  once (README → [docs/TRY-IT.md](docs/TRY-IT.md)); `docs/FRESH-START.md`,
  `docs/ADO-GIT-BROKER.md` and `docs/TEST-GAPS.md` are gone (the troubleshooting
  table moved into TRY-IT); pre-0.4 release notes live in
  [CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md](CHANGELOG-ARCHIVE.md); new [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) index.
- **Diagrams redrawn and gated.** The system-overview diagram has no edge
  crossings and is inlined in the README (the stale `architecture.png` is gone);
  `make diagrams` now label-checks the diagram side too and enforces a style guide.
- **Doc accuracy fixes.** The default-barrier claim now states the CC1 fallback on
  runsc-less hosts; ENV.md documents the real (empty) admin-token default and the
  no-auth local-mode consequence; the compose README's setup-menu note was inverted;
  example TASK.md commands run as written.
- **Build plumbing.** `make release-check` is now a strict superset of `make ci`;
  `make help` is self-documenting; the nightly uploads real e2e evidence; screenshots
  are freshness-gated and the README hero shot is script-captured.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-20

A follow-up to 0.4.1 from the same adopter, now running the containerized stack on a
corporate laptop end to end. The full report, open gaps included, is in
[docs/adoption/](docs/adoption/corp-network-onboarding-findings.md). One entry below is
a regression 0.4.1 introduced; two were bugs that had been silent for longer.

### Fixed

- **An unreachable corporate proxy no longer hangs an approved request.** The upstream
  `CONNECT` handshake had no read deadline, so a proxy that accepted the TCP connection
  and never answered left an *approved* egress sitting forever with nothing to act on —
  the reported "200 then hang" on hosts whose connectivity client binds to loopback
  only. The handshake is bounded; a stalled upstream is now a normal dial failure
  (deny + 502, logged).
- **The `make setup` UI fallback no longer reinstalls.** 0.4.1's host-build retry went
  through `make ui`, whose reinstall fetches platform-specific native binaries
  (`@tailwindcss/oxide-*`, `@esbuild/*`) that a partial mirror also refuses — so the
  fallback died with `node_modules` already complete. It now rebuilds from an existing
  tree when the lockfile matches. Ceiling: a *fresh clone* has no `node_modules`, so
  this fixes the second and later `make setup`, not a cold start.
- **The New Run wizard no longer claims you have no model access when you do.** With an
  operator-configured Bedrock model, the Access step still warned that the run's first
  model call would 404 while dispatch was going to supply model access automatically.
  The preflight now asks the same resolver dispatch uses; when the preflight is
  unavailable the old local check still applies, so a real gap is never hidden.

### Added

- **`wardyn setup proxy-relay <listen-port> <proxy-port>`** forwards a reachable port to
  a forward proxy bound to `127.0.0.1`, which no container can reach. Foreground and
  unsupervised on purpose (Wardyn owns no host daemons); fails immediately if nothing is
  listening. See
  [docs/adoption/loopback-only-forward-proxy.md](docs/adoption/loopback-only-forward-proxy.md).
- **The Host proxy step warns when a detected proxy is loopback-bound**, naming the
  symptom and the fix rather than leaving it to the first launch. Also in
  `wardyn setup status`.
- **`wardyn site-config get|apply`.** The corporate baseline (upstream-proxy ref,
  artifact mirrors, SCM hosts) lives in Postgres, so `make reset` took it with the
  volume and the stack came back healthy with egress silently unconfigured. The baseline
  is now a file you can keep, carrying secret *names* only; `reset-all` names what it is
  about to destroy and prints the capture command first.

### Changed

- **Writable workspaces name the VM-backed-host caveat.** A `writable: true` host mount
  was reported read-only under the Wall tier on macOS; on a native Linux host runc,
  gVisor, Kata and libkrun all wrote successfully, so the cause is the macOS→VM
  file-sharing layer, not the barrier. The Workspaces banner says exactly that, scoped
  to VM-backed runtimes, instead of claiming a tier "cannot write". The measured
  tier↔writability matrix is in the adoption doc.
- **The agent registers its workspace as a git `safe.directory`** — a host-owned
  bind-mounted checkout no longer fails every git command with "dubious ownership",
  which read like a Wardyn defect rather than a uid mismatch.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-20

A corporate-network onboarding fix release from two adopter field reports (kept in
[docs/adoption/](docs/adoption/)). Both are onboarding-trust bugs on the containerized
default path: one hard-blocked `make setup`, the other made the Getting-Started
checklist assert something it never checked. No interface changes.

### Fixed

- **`make setup` no longer dies on a registry that can't serve `pnpm`.** Behind a
  corporate allowlist mirror the image's default `ui-build` stage failed with a raw
  `npm error code E404` (or 403) and the stack never came up — the one command the docs
  tell a new user to run did not work. `scripts/up.sh` now catches the failed build and
  retries with the UI built on your host (`make ui` + `WARDYN_UI_STAGE=ui-prebuilt`).
  An explicit `WARDYN_UI_STAGE` is still honored and disables the fallback, and a
  working registry never enters the retry branch. Probing the registry first does not
  work: the 404 is on the *tarball* path, which a metadata-proxying mirror answers 200.
- **Staging a corporate CA no longer breaks the image build.** `ui-build` ran
  `update-ca-certificates`, which its `node:*-bookworm-slim` base purges — so any
  operator who followed `make doctor`'s own advice and staged
  `deploy/images/corp-ca.pem` hit a hard `exit 127`, every time. The stage relies on
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` alone now (npm/pnpm are its only TLS clients), and
  `deploy/images/README.md`'s snippet — which produced the bug — was corrected.
- **The Host proxy step tells the truth on the containerized stack.**
  `DetectHostProxy()` runs *in* the wardynd process, and in a distroless container every
  tier is structurally blind (container-only env, no `HOME`, no `git`, and the OS/PAC
  tier dispatches on the *process's* `GOOS`) — so it reported "no host-side proxy
  detected" on hosts unambiguously behind one. `make setup` now runs the same detector
  **on the host** (new `wardyn setup detect-proxy`, from a host-native binary the image
  cross-compiles) and seeds the result in, re-running on every `up` so it cannot go
  stale. Deliberately **not** done by forwarding `HTTP_PROXY` into wardynd's runtime
  environment: Go's `net/http` honors those names process-wide, which would silently
  reroute wardynd's own OIDC discovery, audit webhooks, GitHub App minting and AWS
  credential chain. A run's egress is unaffected either way.
- **An honest empty result when detection genuinely can't look** — the step now says
  detection ran inside the container, names what it therefore could not read, and
  carries a next step. The static lede that rendered above an empty result is gone.
- **A set-but-empty `HTTP_PROXY` no longer counts as a detected proxy.** `os.LookupEnv`
  reports ok for `export HTTP_PROXY=`; empty and whitespace-only values are now filtered
  in the one place all tiers route through.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-19

Wardyn remains **pre-alpha**: interfaces are not stable and this release changes several
defaults. Read "Upgrading from 0.3.1" below before pulling it onto a 0.3.1 host.

### Added

- **Container as an execution environment.** A workspace can be a container image (new
  `container` kind), and any workspace/container can carry an operator-owned
  model/harness credential binding (`none|managed|api_key|bedrock` — names and refs, never
  values). A run inherits the binding of the workspace it picks; it is folded into the run
  policy at create and injected proxy-side. `PUT /workspaces/{id}/llm-cred`, migration
  `0024_workspace_llm_cred`.
- **YAML policies.** `wardyn run --policy-file` and `wardyn policy create|update -f` accept
  JSON or YAML; `wardyn policy render -f <file>` converts and strictly validates offline.
  Commented examples in `examples/policies/`.
- **`wardyn subscription connect|status|disconnect`.** Capture a `claude setup-token` from
  **stdin only**, stored age-encrypted and injected proxy-side; the sandbox holds an inert
  sentinel. Idempotent (`--reconnect` to replace). `WARDYN_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` seeds it
  headlessly. The setup-token is long-lived (~1 year) and non-rotating — documented, not
  hidden.
- **`wardyn setup status`** — the console's readiness checklist in the terminal, each unmet
  check naming the exact next command.
- **AI Run Composer on the container path** — the real `claude` in a governed one-shot
  sandbox with the managed subscription injected proxy-side, fail-closed when no
  subscription is connected.
- **Containerized AWS SSO login for Bedrock.** A device-code login for SSO-only orgs: no
  host `aws sso login`, no `~/.aws` mount. `deploy/images/aws-sso` keeps ~600 MB of AWS CLI
  out of normal runs. **Honest bound:** the SSO token and derived role credentials are
  **resident** in the sandbox (amber chip in the UI) and Wardyn cannot revoke a captured
  SSO session. Validated against a fake sso-oidc/portal built from real botocore models,
  not live IAM Identity Center.
- **Standard AWS environment is honored** as a fallback — `WARDYN_BEDROCK_REGION` /
  `_AWS_PROFILE` fall back to `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` / `AWS_PROFILE`. Region
  alone cannot enable Bedrock, so this cannot switch the transport on by surprise.
- **Corporate-network image builds.** Corp-CA staging and `NPM_REGISTRY` /
  `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` thread through every build; `UI_STAGE`
  (`ui-prebuilt` via `WARDYN_UI_STAGE`) consumes a host-built `ui/dist`. **corepack does
  not work around a mirror missing pnpm** — it fetches the same 404ing path.
- **Opt-in native agent-CLI install for corp networks** (npm stays the default):
  `CLAUDE_INSTALL=native` is checksum-verified against `downloads.claude.ai` (the only host
  it contacts) or a host-staged binary; `CODEX_INSTALL=native` is staged-only, because
  codex has no Wardyn-verified download contract.
- **Shared-host concurrency for the compose control plane.** Every explicitly named compose
  object is parameterized off `WARDYN_NS` (default `wardyn`, so the single-user default is
  byte-for-byte unchanged), and `ci-run.sh` takes a per-job project name, ephemeral ports
  and a project-scoped `down --volumes`. `make test-e2e-concurrent` is the live two-job
  acceptance test. Boundary: safe for **one trusted operator**, not for mutually
  distrusting tenants.
- **Fail-closed resource caps.** The daemon's `ContainerCreate` warnings are authoritative:
  any "…Limitation discarded" refuses the run. `WARDYN_ALLOW_UNENFORCEABLE_CAPS=1`
  overrides on a trusted host.
- **Run type in the New Run wizard** — "Agent run" vs "Governed command"
  (`task_mode=exec`, no agent, no LLM credentials), and bring-your-own base image promoted
  out of Advanced.
- **Harness-aware demo.** A fifth demo ("The agent in the box") appears on `/demos` once a
  model provider is connected. The four keyless egress-boundary demos stay LLM-free.
- **Enterprise onboarding and a corp-aware `doctor`.** The wizard exposes the Bedrock
  credentials the backend already read (never-resident `bedrock-api-key` first); `up.sh`
  wires operator Bedrock config into `deploy/compose/.env`; Rancher Desktop is detected and
  its non-bind-mountable socket remapped; `doctor` warns on a proxy with no corp CA staged
  and asserts the chosen docker socket is bind-mountable, not merely reachable.
- **Rootless and Podman: documented and probed.** Rootless Docker/Podman is supported at
  **CC1 only**; CC2/CC3 are refused fail-closed. `scripts/test-podman.sh` passes against a
  live rootless Podman 4.9.3.
- **Never-resident Azure DevOps git egress: a reviewed design only, not built.** The
  working lane is still the resident `git_pat` grant; the ceiling (ADO has no
  token-minting API, so the operator PAT's scope is the boundary) is in
  [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#named-gaps-without-a-milestone).

### Changed

- **`make setup` is containerized by default.** Host mode is an advanced escape hatch
  (`WARDYN_SETUP_MODE=local`); `WARDYN_SETUP_MODE=team` prints a notice and exits.
- **First-run setup is a mandatory gate** for a *new* console: every route except `/setup`
  and `/demos` redirects until it completes, and the side doors are gone. Team/SSO
  deployments are never gated.
- **The model/harness provider is optional.** Only the sandbox barrier is required; the
  `llm_provider` check is INFO and the step is skippable. Agent runs and the Composer need a
  provider; a governed command, a BYO container and an interactive run do not.
- **The model step asks about the harness first**, then that harness's credential path, each
  named for the credential rather than the mechanism, and each keeping its posture chip
  (green proxy-injected, amber resident).
- **The setup funnel is ordered by prerequisite, not by theme** — Host Proxy and Artifact
  Redirect move into Essentials ahead of the model step, and Credentials precedes
  Workspaces.
- **The AI Run Composer is marked Beta**, and its "Proposed setup" review leads with what
  blocks you (rationale and `model_notes` collapse behind disclosures).
- **Setup persists the chosen Docker socket** into `deploy/compose/.env`. It was set in the
  environment only, so any `docker compose up -d wardynd` outside `up.sh` drove compose's
  default socket — on a dual-daemon box, silently collapsing the barrier to Fence-only.
- **Operator-supplied egress domains are validated server-side.** A mid-label wildcard like
  `oidc.*.amazonaws.com` compiles to a hostname no request can equal; one predicate,
  `ValidDomainEntry`, now runs at the `validatePolicySpec` chokepoint every ingest path uses.
  **This can reject a policy 0.3.1 accepted — but only entries that never matched anything.**
- **A half-specified per-workspace Bedrock override is rejected at write time** (a model id
  is region-scoped, so region-without-model fails at invoke). Omitting the block still
  inherits everything.
- **The resident-secret disclosure is corrected.** The threat model claimed "two named,
  bounded exceptions" in three places that disagreed on which two; reading the code there
  are **eight**, including this release's AWS SSO token. §5.1a is now the single
  authoritative enumeration.
- **The compose banner's "production path is Kubernetes" claim is corrected**: the
  Kubernetes data plane is v0.5-planned and cannot create sandboxes yet.
- **CLI list output prints ids in full** — `run list` printed 8-character ids that
  `run kill` then rejected; same for approvals and policies.
- Personal paths and usernames are scrubbed from the tree, and the repo gates are back in
  truth with it (diagram manifest re-pointed after the `runs.go` split, `workspaces.tsx`
  split on two single-concern seams instead of allowlisted, image-pin gate resolving a bare
  `${VAR}` against the Dockerfile's own `ARG` default).

### Fixed

- **A workspace's model credential binding never reached the run's persisted grants — and
  the operator's Claude subscription was billed for it.** `persistRunGrants` snapshotted
  the spec before `applyWorkspaceCreds` mutated it, so a workspace bound to its own
  `api_key` fell through to the managed subscription and `managed`/`bedrock` could not
  displace a competing api-key grant. Credential resolution now runs **before** grants are
  persisted. Visible consequence: `api.anthropic.com` is contributed by the binding, so it
  no longer appears in `run.workspace.egress` `added_domains` (the sets dedupe — the
  effective policy is unchanged).
- **Per-workspace Bedrock bindings are actually applied** — region/model/profile thread
  through `resolveBedrockAuth`, the region's hosts join the run's egress, and the SSO region
  falls back to the *effective* region. Not claimed, because it needs live Bedrock:
  cross-region inference-profile resolution and the bearer-mode exchange.
- **The AWS SSO login pre-allowed three hosts the proxy could never match**
  (`oidc.*.amazonaws.com` and friends are mid-label wildcards), so login failed on the very
  hosts it claimed to allow and stored an empty account/role. Regional hosts are now derived
  from the effective SSO region; with none configured they surface as first-use approvals,
  deliberately not falling back to `*.amazonaws.com`. Net egress is narrower than 0.3.1.
- **The AWS SSO login sandbox had no `~/.aws` at all** while the pane auto-typed a command
  needing `sso_start_url`/`sso_region`. The pane now collects the org portal URL and the
  server seeds an all-or-nothing session block; a missing/non-https/whitespace-bearing start
  URL or a missing SSO region is refused with 400.
- **The `aws-sso` image was offered by the setup UI but built by neither setup path** —
  first use failed at pull against a `:local` tag. Both build loops now build it.
- **The first-run gate could lock an existing console out on a transient daemon blip.** It
  keyed on `!has_runs || !ready`; it now keys on the console being new. (0.3.1's claim that
  returning consoles are never gated was not true.)
- **The managed Claude subscription never actually worked for runs** —
  `detect_anthropic_mode` looked only under `~/.claude`, so a subscription materialized into
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` fell through to apikey mode and surfaced "401 Invalid bearer token".
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is checked first now.
- **The composer's model-access verdict was gated on the wrong toggle** — the per-run "use
  subscription" opt-in gates the credential *mount*, which a managed subscription does not
  need. Mount gating and verdict are now separate.
- **The New Run wizard silently dropped bring-your-own-image and `task_mode`** — neither was
  forwarded onto the wire, so BYOI was lost end to end from the UI.
- **The subscription login URL arrived truncated** — `claude setup-token` hard-wraps its
  OAuth URL at the PTY width; the login PTY is forced to 512 columns.
- **The composer review printed two sentences twice** (the model-access line and, on the
  blocked path, the top risk rationale).
- **The resource-cap gate ran after `ContainerStart`, and its probe false-positived on
  Podman.** An untrusted container on an uncapped host ran for the duration of the check
  before rollback; the gate now sits between create and start. The probe trusted `docker
  info`'s `MemoryLimit`/`PidsLimit`/`CPUCfsQuota` booleans, which rootless Podman 4.9.3
  under-reports — those are now only an advisory `doctor` hint.
- `examples/policies/sandbox-claude.yaml`'s `github_token` grant had `repos: []`, which the
  git-broker rejects. Docker-tagged AWS SSO tests no longer burn a 30-second timeout each
  against an image nothing builds.

### Security

- **The dex host port was published on `0.0.0.0`.** It is now loopback-only and
  parameterized (`WARDYN_DEX_PORT`); dex only runs under the `sso` compose profile.
- Server-side egress-domain validation (see Changed) closes a defect class where an
  operator-authored allowlist entry could be silently dead. Adversarial review caught the
  first version of the predicate failing open in exactly the way it was written to prevent.
- `pkg/client`'s `HarnessLogin` method is deleted — zero callers, and both `client.go` and
  `docs/sdk.md` already listed harness-login as **not** SDK-covered.

### Upgrading from 0.3.1

- **`make setup` now brings up the containerized stack.** For host mode, pass
  `WARDYN_SETUP_MODE=local` explicitly.
- **Re-run setup on an existing compose deployment** (or hand-edit `deploy/compose/.env`):
  `WARDYN_DOCKER_SOCK` is now persisted there. With more than one Docker daemon, skipping
  this silently collapses the barrier to Fence-only.
- **A host that cannot enforce resource caps will now refuse to launch runs**
  (`resource caps not enforceable on this host`). Fix the host, or set
  `WARDYN_ALLOW_UNENFORCEABLE_CAPS=1` to get 0.3.1's uncapped behavior back.
- **A fresh console cannot be skipped past Getting Started.** Automation that drove a new
  local-mode console straight to `/runs` must complete setup or seed the completion flag.
- **Check your policies for mid-label wildcards** — such an entry never matched any
  request, so rewriting it changes what your policy *does*, not just whether it saves.
- **Check any per-workspace Bedrock binding** — half-specified overrides are rejected on
  write, and a complete one is now actually applied at dispatch.
- **Verify which runs your workspace credential bindings bill** — an `api_key` binding was
  previously ignored and billed to the managed subscription.
- Rebuild your agent images (`make agent-images-core` or `scripts/up.sh`) — the `aws-sso`
  image is new and is pulled by tag from no registry.
