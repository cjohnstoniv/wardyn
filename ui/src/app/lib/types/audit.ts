// (internal/egress/proxy/tool_rules.go). An `allow` or a `deny` creates NO
// approval card, so the audit trail is the only place that decision is ever
// visible — and it rides an egress.allow / egress.deny event whose target is
// the CONTROL PLANE, because emitLocalDecision logs against controlPlaneURL's
// host (local_routes.go). data.rule_source is what makes it distinguishable
// from real network egress at all.
//
// The one runtime export in this file, and deliberately here: BOTH the egress
// projection that must exclude these rows (lib/api/audit.ts) and the component
// that relabels them (wardyn/audit-decision.tsx) read it, and lib/api must not
// import from components/.
