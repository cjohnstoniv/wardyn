// (WARDYN_AUTONOMY_LEVEL) and the create audit row's `autonomy` block all cite
// one source.
//
// A runner that does not advertise Capabilities.ManagedFiles gets no file and
// the run still launches, under its CLI-flag levers alone. That is the
// decided fallback, not an oversight: refusing would make every L0–L2
// claude-code run undeployable on a substrate without the contract, and the
// row records delivered:false with the reason, so the gap is visible where an
// operator looks for it. Handing such a runner the file anyway would be worse
// than withholding it — a driver that cannot make it root-owned would place a
// ceiling the agent can rewrite, reported as delivered.
